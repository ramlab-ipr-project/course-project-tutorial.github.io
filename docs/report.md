# Report

## Project Report Guide

A report acts as papers in conferences for our course. So it must contains:

- Overview of your contribution
- Core algorithm/method/proposal
- Motivations/Applications for your work
- Conclusions/Limitations/Future work
- etc

## A general outline
Temporarily **no standard template** for the report. If you want more detailed guides, you can contact with TA through email. Here is **a sample outline**:

1. Introduction/Overview
Abstract for your work.
1. Environment setup
Including the platform we introduce in the tutorial, you need also make a simple illustration of libraries or external ROS packages you use, like openCV/gmap/AMCL, etc.
1. System design and modules implement <br>
** Notes: teams should show their contribution assignments here, i.e., who implements which parts. This is a important reference for me to grade you. **<br>
Use several subsections to describe the function and implement for each module. I suggest each team member take his/her own part. If you're using latex, the documents can be joined together easily.
1. Conclusion
Which covers topics like motivations/applications/limitaions/future work, a multi-aspects discussion on your work.
1. References
Tutorials you follow, papers/books you read, for other people to follow your work.

## Expected report pages:
No hard requirement. You only need to conclude your team contributions, with enough information.  <br>
