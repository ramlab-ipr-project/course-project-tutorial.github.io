This is a important reference for me to grade you. Use several subsections to describe the function and implement for each module. I suggest each team member take his/her own part. If you're using latex, the documents can be joined together easily. Conclusion Which covers topics like motivations/applications/limitaions/future work, a multi-aspects discussion on your work. References Tutorials you follow, papers/books you read, for other people to follow your work. Expected report pages: No hard requirement. You only need to conclude your team contributions, with enough information.","title":"Report"},{"location":"report/#report","text":"","title":"Report"},{"location":"report/#project-report-guide","text":"A report acts as papers in conferences for our course.

Now the scene will also publish \"/clock\" message to ROS and set rosparam \"use_sim_time\" to \"true\" by default. As a result, launching nodes and rviz after the V-REP initialization, we can see ROS being synchronize with simulation time (all timestamps, /tf trees will be using simulation time in V-REP). In your own ROS nodes (e.g. python), you will get simulation time with the standard rospy . get_time () This update should not affect your existing code and is expected to fix the TF_OLD_DATA problem. Hints: It is now possible to integrate velocity command to produce coarse/noisy odometry. Enviroment The newest version of regarding softwares is recommended. ROS: Kinetic V-REP: 3.6.2 PRO EDU :Please Select Pro EDU for your own ubuntu version Plugins(Please git clone them from the latest master): vrep_ros_bridge vrep_ros_interface Platform: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS The above environment was tested before. If you have any problems, please contact yliuhb@connect.ust.hk I personally tested the raw V-REP: 3.6.2 PRO EDU on ROS-Melodic/Ubuntu 18.04 without vrep_ros_bridge or vrep_ros_interface , and the rostopics also work fine for me. Demo After configuring the environment, run roscore And in another terminal, run(under the unzipped VREP_ROOT) . / vrep . sh In V-REP, load the updated scene file env.ttt . After pressing the start button , you can use rostopic list to see the Topics of vrep. Topics we need: /vrep/camera_switch /vrep/cmd_vel /vrep/image /vrep/laser_switch /vrep/scan /tf Check the meta-info of a topic: rostopic info / vrep / cmd_vel For controling the Pioneer p3dx robot, type the following in terminal ## Translation rostopic pub - r 10 / vrep / cmd_vel geometry_msgs / Twist '{linear: {x: 1.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}}' ## Rotation rostopic pub - r 10 / vrep / cmd_vel geometry_msgs / Twist '{linear: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 1.0}}' where x in \"linear\" stands for the velocity of the robot (forward as positive), and z in \"angular\" for the rotation (counter clockwise observed from top as positive). Make sure you can receive lidar scanner output (/vrep/scan), camera output (/vrep/image) and the coordinate transform from base_link to camera_link/laser_link (/tf) on ROS side. You can verify these with ros commands/rviz or your own codes.
