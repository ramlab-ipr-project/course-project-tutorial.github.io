So it must contains: Overview of your contribution Core algorithm/method/proposal Motivations/Applications for your work Conclusions/Limitations/Future work etc A general outline Temporarily no standard template for the report. If you want more detailed guides, you can contact with me through email TA Yuxuan, Liu . Here is a sample outline : Introduction/Overview Abstract for your work. Environment setup Including the platform we introduce in the tutorial, you need also make a simple illustration of libraries or external ROS packages you use, like openCV/gmap/AMCL, etc. System design and modules implement Notes: teams should show their contribution assignments here, i.e., who implements which parts. This is a important reference for me to grade you. Use several subsections to describe the function and implement for each module. I suggest each team member take his/her own part. If you're using latex, the documents can be joined together easily. Conclusion Which covers topics like motivations/applications/limitaions/future work, a multi-aspects discussion on your work. References Tutorials you follow, papers/books you read, for other people to follow your work. Expected report pages: No hard requirement. You only need to conclude your team contributions, with enough information. Some people can use abstract words while describing a complex system. Or you can use more media info like images/videos links to make your report more intuitive for readers. Basically if your report contains enough information, it should be about 6~12 pages(just biased estimation). More pages are acceptable.","title":"Report"},{"location":"report/#report","text":"","title":"Report"},{"location":"report/#project-report-guide","text":"Author: Yuxuan, Liu Date: 2019.04.17 A report acts as papers in conferences for our course.

ROS: Kinetic V-REP: 3.5.0 PRO EDU Plugins(Please git clone them from the latest master): vrep_ros_bridge vrep_ros_interface Platform: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS The above environment was tested before. If you have any problems, please contact yliuhb@connect.ust.hk I personally tested the raw V-REP: 3.5.0 PRO EDU on ROS-Melodic/Ubuntu 18.04 without vrep_ros_bridge or vrep_ros_interface , and the rostopics also work fine for me. Demo After configuring the environment, run roscore And in another terminal, run(under the unzipped VREP_ROOT) . / vrep . sh In V-REP, load the scene file env.ttt . After pressing the start button , you can use rostopic list to see the Topics of vrep. Topics we need: /vrep/camera_switch /vrep/cmd_vel /vrep/image /vrep/laser_switch /vrep/scan /tf Check the meta-info of a topic: rostopic info / vrep / cmd_vel For controling the Pioneer p3dx robot, type the following in terminal ## Translation rostopic pub - r 10 / vrep / cmd_vel geometry_msgs / Twist '{linear: {x: 1.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}}' ## Rotation rostopic pub - r 10 / vrep / cmd_vel geometry_msgs / Twist '{linear: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 1.0}}' where x in \"linear\" stands for the velocity of the robot (forward as positive), and z in \"angular\" for the rotation (counter clockwise observed from top as positive). Make sure you can receive lidar scanner output (/vrep/scan), camera output (/vrep/image) and the coordinate transform from base_link to camera_link/laser_link (/tf) on ROS side. You can verify these with ros commands/rviz or your own codes. Getting more familiar with ROS is part of the project, you could contact me for help while you are encouraged to solve them your own first.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#setup","text":"Author: Yuxuan, Liu Date: 2020.04.17","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#enviroment","text":"The newest version of regarding softwares is recommended.
